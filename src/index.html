This is where notices of availability of documents, such as permit applications, are published to provide the public an opportunity to comment.</p>                      <p>Notice of receipt of a permit application for proposed activities involving endangered species is required pursuant to Section 10(c) of the Endangered Species Act. This means that receipt of your permit application must be published on the Federal Register for 30 days before we can legally issue your new, renewal, or amended permit. Receipt of applications involving proposed activities with threatened species, or those involving minor amendments (e.g., change of address), do not require Federal Register notification. Depending on the number of applications received each month, the Division of Environmental Review in Region 4 generally sends a notice of receipt document to be published once a month. To find the notice of receipt of an application, use the Service Documents <a href="http://policy.fws.gov/frsystem/default.cfm">search</a> by applicant name.</p>                    </div>                    <p>                      <a href="#top"><img src="./images/paw.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Paw graphic" />Return to Top</a>                    </p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                  </div>                  <!-- #four -->                  <div id="five">                    <p class="faq-answer-title">5.

In addition to the FR notice-period requirement, applications are reviewed by relevant Regional Recovery Leads and species experts in Field Offices in each state that the applicant proposes to conduct activities. Applications are also sent to Regional Permit Coordinators outside of the Southeast Region when applicants propose to conduct activities outside of the Southeast (see the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/Endangered/regions/index.html">US FWS regional boundaries</a>).</p>                      <p>Species experts and Regional Recovery Leads review the qualifications of individuals to conduct proposed activities and assess the potential impacts of proposed activities on listed species. In the simplest cases (i.e., applications involving 1 species and 1 state), permit processing goes through the steps in the diagram below. As the number of species, states, and regions increases, so does the complexity of permit processing and, in turn, permit processing time.</p>                    </div>                    <div class="diagram">                      <img src="./images/permit-diagram.png" alt="Permit Review Process" title="Permit Review Process">                    </div>                    <p>                      <a href="#top"><img src="./images/paw.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Paw graphic" />Return to Top</a>                    </p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                  </div>                  <!-- #seven -->                  <div id="eight">                    <p class="faq-answer-title">8.

During formal consultation, the Permit Coordinator and the Recovery Lead share information about the proposed project and the species that is likely to be affected. Formal consultation may last up to 90 days, after which the Service will prepare a Biological Opinion on whether the proposed activity will <em>jeopardize</em> the continued existence of a listed species. The Service has 45 days after completion of formal consultation to write the Opinion.</p>                      <p>In making a determination on whether an action will result in jeopardy, the Service begins by looking at the current status of the species, or &#8220;baseline.&#8221; Added to the baseline are the various effects – direct, indirect, interrelated, and interdependent – of the proposed Federal action. The Service also examines the cumulative effects of other non-Federal actions that may occur in the action area, including state, tribal, local, or private activities that are reasonably certain to occur in the project area.</p>                      <p>Note that, if your project is determined to have &#8220;no effect&#8221; or a &#8220;not likely to adversely affect&#8221; determination, you may not need a Section 10(a)(1)(A) permit. This is why it is important to first contact the Field Office in which you are conducting proposed activities prior to submitting a permit application to the Regional Office. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service staff can help you determine whether your proposed project or action is likely to result in &#8220;take,&#8221; whether a permit is required, or if there are other options to consider. </p>                    </div>                    <p>                      <a href="#top"><img src="./images/paw.png" width="16" height="16" alt="Paw graphic" />Return to Top</a>                    </p>                    <p>&nbsp;</p>                  </div>                  <!-- #eight -->                  <div id="nine">                    <p class="faq-answer-title">Who do I contact if I have a question regarding the permit process?</p>                    <div class="faq-answer">                      <p>If you have questions that have not been addressed on this website, or any of the web-links provided here-in, contact the <a href="mailto:permitsR4es@fws.gov?Subject=10a1a%20Permitting%20Question">Region 4 Permit Coordinator</a>.
